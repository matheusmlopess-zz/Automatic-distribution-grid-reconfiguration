   FUSE model demo for IEEE 123 test feeder supplied with OpenDSS

   Define a lateral fuse and put a Monitor at the same location
   Fuse will have the same number of phases as the monitored element (1 in this case)
   Two TCC_Curve objects for fuses are defined by default for every circuit: KLINK and TLINK

solve  ! snapshot prior to dynamics mode to get Monitor and Fuse assimilated into circuit

// solve a few steps (1 60-Hz cycle) in Dynamics mode just to get everything going
Solve mode=dynamics stepsize=0.0016666666 number=10

// Add a fault at the end of the lateral
New Fault.F1 phases=1 Bus1=6.3
Solve number=100   ! solve 10 cycles, still in Dynamics mode
